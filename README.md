# Cube
Solving a Rubik's Cube with attention-based neural networks

This project creates, trains and evaluates different neural network models that can be used to solve the Rubik's Cube.

The resources provided here include:
* The tensorflow code to create the neural network models.
* The code to represent, change and display the Rubik's Cube.
* Methods to train and evaluate the neural networks.
* Checkpoints for all models, achieving good solving performance.

## Requirements

This project runs with Python 3.8 and tensorflow 2.4.0.

## How to run

The file main.py contains all methods that are needed to create models, load the corresponding weights,
train the models and evaluate them. This code is not created to be run with command line arguments,
all methods that are supposed to be run have to be called manually, for example by adding them to the
main method and running it inside an IDE.
